# Friend-Finder
***
Friend Finder is a basic "dating app" but for friends (because some of us are just plain lonely).  This full-stack site takes in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users.  The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### Getting Started
***

If you would like to make your own adjustments and improvements, feel free to clone this repo onto your PC and have fun with it.

### Technologies Used:
***

The programs used to make this app are:

* HTML
* Bootstrap
* Javascript (JQuery)
* Node.JS
* Heroku
* npm packages:
    - [path] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/path)
    - [express] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
    - [body-parser] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)

### Future Enhancements:
***
Some future enhancements I would like to make are finding a way to add some custom CSS to make it look more professional and for the picture URL section, I would like to implement an option to browse for a picture on the user's desktop and insert it into the input line.
